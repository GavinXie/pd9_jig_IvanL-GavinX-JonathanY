5/26/14 | Jonathan want to make Solitaire
5/27/14 We reproposed to make Slap Jack instead. Emailed Mr. Brown.
5/28/14 Talked to Mr. Brown and need to figure out data structure(pros/cons). Also, need to think about stretch goals for our next meeting.
        We decided to have the discard pile be an ArrayList while the player hands will be queues. The ArrayList will randomly be chosen to be
        added to the bottom of the queue. 
        We also need to decide the "slap" and how it will work wheater it is time based or probability based.
        Stretch Goals Brainstorm: Multiple players on the same keyboard/computer. 
                                  Special game modes. (More Deck Cards, chance of drawing spec. events, increased range of numbers)
                                  Combine with other games? (Crazy 8s)
        Need component breakdown, UML, sequential to-do list.
