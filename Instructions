The Games:

SlapJack(GUI):
The game starts with a standaard 52 card deck. Each player participating is handed an equal share of this deck.
No one has the ability to see his or her cards. In the middle is a discard pile. One by one and consecutively,
each player places their top card into the pile. Each card that is placed in the pile is assigned a value of mod 13.
Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, Kings are 13. If the card's value is the same as the card itself, players should try to slap the pile. Whoever successfully slaps
the pile first wins the deck and so, collects the pile and shuffles it and adds it to the bottom of this own deck.
The game ends when one player  has possession of all the cards.


CrazyEights(Terminal):
This is a spin off of the classic game Uno. It is played with a standard 52 card deck. At the start each player
is given 8 cards into their hand. They can view all their cards at once. The objective of the game is to get rid of 
all the cards in your hand first. You do this by discarding cards from your hand into the pile in the middle. 
The discard pile is automatically started with one card in the middle. Cards that can be placed have to follow certain rules.
In general, cards must have the same value or suit as the previously placed card. Exceptions to this rule are when 
an eight or an ace is place. An eight represents a wild card and hence, can change the suit at will of the player.
Aces are draw 4s which in addition to the abilities of an eight, forces the next player in line to draw 4 cards from the 
deck. 
Other cards that have special abilities are the
2: draw 2
Jack: skips the next player
Queen: reverses the order of turns
